# Task1 Sample Project

Git repository setup, branching strategies, merging, and conflict resolution. 


###  1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhinav059/Task1_Sample_Project.git
```
This will download the project files and the entire repository history.

###  2: Navigate to the Project Folder

```bash
cd Task1_Sample_Project
```

### 3:verify that everything is set up correctly by running:

```
git status
```


### Check Out the Branches
To see all available branches, run:

```bash
git branch -a
```

### Branching and Merging

```bash
git checkout -b feature
```

This will create a new branch named `feature` and switch you to it.

### Make Changes to the Code

After switching to the feature branch, make your changes in the project files and you can stage the changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature"
```

### Push the Feature Branch to GitHub

```bash
git push origin feature
```

###  Merge the Feature Branch into the Main Branch

1. Switch back to the `main` branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```

2. Pull the latest changes from the remote `main` branch to make sure your local `main` is up-to-date:

   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

3. Merge the `feature` branch into `main`:

   ```bash
   git merge feature
   ```

   If there are any conflicts, Git will notify you, and you can resolve them by editing the conflicted files.

4. After resolving any conflicts and committing the resolved files, push the merged changes to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

## Merge Conflict Resolution


### Step 1: Conflict

When Git cannot merge the branches automatically, 

You will need to manually resolve the conflict in the affected files.

### Step 2: Edit the Conflicted Files

Open the files that have conflicts. Git will mark the areas with conflicts like this:

```plaintext
<<<<<<< HEAD
Your code on the main branch
=======
Your code from the feature branch
>>>>>>> feature
```

You need to decide which code to keep (either from `main` or `feature`), or you can combine them manually.

### Step 3: Stage the Resolved Files

Once you've resolved the conflicts, stage the resolved files:

```bash
git add <file-name>
```

### Step 4: Complete the Merge

After staging the resolved files, complete the merge by committing the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict between main and feature"
```

### Step 5: Push the Changes

```bash
git push origin main
```
